# Contributing

We love to work with our community! If there is a problem that you find yourself
constantly solving, such as boilerplate for a common setup or integration with
a third party, let us know! It may be a good candidate for Extend, which will
provide support for the library or tool.

You don't even have to write any code. We have an RFC process for helping flesh
out new ideas and in many cases we will do the bulk of the development. All the
code will be released as open source libraries and tools for anyone to use.

## Proposing a new Specification

Every tool for Extend needs to have a specification defined. This specification
details the problem being solved, a proposed solution, and any additional notes
for future developers. Each specification goes through an RFC process.

1. Open an issue to begin the dialog of if an idea is appropriate for Extend
1. If the general idea sounds good, a proposal document will be generated
1. Fork this repository, and edit the proposal
1. Submit a PR back to this project
1. Once the proposal is finished, it will be merged
1. A vote will be called as a final once-over for the proposal
1. If accepted, the proposal document will move to `accepted`
